About:
  - This is a C++ library for clustering data. It uses Boost.Geometry R*-trees
    for fast indexing. The DBSCAN implementation can cluster 20 million 2D datum 
    in around an hour, and 20 thousand in seconds.

  - At the moment, only (vanilla) DBSCAN is implemented. It is based on the article
    "A Density-Based Algorithm for Discovering Clusters" by Ester, Kriegel, Sander,
    and Xu in 1996. DBSCAN is generally regarded as a solid, reliable clustering
    technique compared with techniques such as k-means (which is, for example, 
    unable to cluster concave clusters).

  - Other clustering techniques are planned.

Compilation instructions:
  - This library is header-only.
    - It does not need to be linked.
    - It has no run-time dependencies.
    - It can be installed to, e.g., /usr/include/, or kept in-source as needed.

  - This library requires Boost.Geometry (also header only) version >= 1.57.0.
    - Earlier versions will most likely still work. Not tested.
